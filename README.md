Known Issues
============

 Please do NOT report any bugs regarding the ClojureScript or HTML + JS programs. 

-- There may be a bug or two dealing with Game Flow.

-- There are latency issues with the ClojureScript and JS versions. I do not yet know why these issues exist. They can make certain "issues" appear that probably aren't issues, like turns out of order, missed turns, etc. There are a few latency issues in the command line version as well.
